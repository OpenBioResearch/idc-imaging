Melanoma is a cancer of increasing prevalence that is curable with minor surgery if detected early but life-threatening when it metastasizes. Melanomas metastasize when still small, making early detection essential but challenging. Our atlas will delineate the precise sequence of events leading up to pre-melanoma through detailed spatial analysis of cell-autonomous events such as oncogene mutation and non-autonomous events such as escape from immune surveillance. The atlas is based on highly-multiplexed tissue imaging and single cell sequencing and focused on samples in which the full sequence of events from atypia to invasive melanoma can be visualized in a single specimen. The atlas will serve as a publicly accessible resource for research scientists, physicians, and patients and improve our ability to (i) highlight lesions likely to progress to cancer, (ii) identify high-risk patients to inform decisions on surgery, (iii) identify low-risk patients to reduce unnecessary procedures, (iv) design improved procedures for routine screening of all individuals, and (v) inform treatment options when surgery is insufficient.

The OMS Atlas is motivated by the appreciation that these treatments are often effective in primary tumors but only transiently effective in the metastatic setting. Possible resistance mechanisms include tumor-intrinsic genomic instability and epigenomic plasticity, as well as events extrinsic to the cancer cells, including chemical and mechanical signals from the microenvironments, production of mechanical extracellular matrix barriers and/or changes in vasculature that reduce drug and/or immune cell access, nanoscale cancer cell-microenvironment interactions that reduce drug efficacy, and a plethora of immune resistance mechanisms, such as loss of HLA expression and antigen presentation, and immune exhaustion. These mechanisms likely vary between patients and within individual patients and change with time as tumors respond to therapeutic attack. The OMS Atlas will focus on elucidating resistance mechanisms in two specific current generation clinical trial scenarios: (a) hormone receptor-positive breast cancer (HRBC) undergoing treatment with a CDK4/6 inhibitor in combination with endocrine therapy and (b) triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) undergoing treatment with a PARP inhibitor and an immunomodulatory agent.</p>\n<p>\n       Please see the <a href=\"\" url=\"https://humantumoratlas.org/hta9/\" data-toggle=\"modal\" data-target=\"#external-web-warning\" class=\"external-link\">HTAN-OHSU <i class=\"fa-solid fa-external-link external-link-icon\" aria-hidden=\"true\"></i></a> information page to learn more about the images and to obtain any supporting metadata for this collection.</p>\n<p>\n      Citation guidelines can be found on the <a href=\"\" url=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1seSp9yo8mqMK5sFXd4LEf_t_4SEofZi-1p-M75R1lhk/edit#heading=h.ybiv33wzts40\" data-toggle=\"modal\" data-target=\"#external-web-warning\" class=\"external-link\">HTAN Publication Policy <i class=\"fa-solid fa-external-link external-link-icon\" aria-hidden=\"true\"></i></a> information page.</p>\n",

The biospecimens from these participants will be used for single-cell RNA sequencing, whole exome sequencing, multiplex immunofluorescence, species-specific bacterial fluorescence in situ hybridization, and other approaches. Finally, the information from these approaches will be integrated to develop a single-cell pre-cancer atlas with defined molecular phenotypes for dissemination to the broader scientific community.</p>\n<p>\n       Please see the <a href=\"\" url=\"https://humantumoratlas.org/hta11/\" data-toggle=\"modal\" data-target=\"#external-web-warning\" class=\"external-link\">HTAN-Vanderbilt <i class=\"fa-solid fa-external-link external-link-icon\" aria-hidden=\"true\"></i></a> information page to learn more about the images and to obtain any supporting metadata for this collection.</p>\n<p>\n      Citation guidelines can be found on the <a href=\"\" url=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1seSp9yo8mqMK5sFXd4LEf_t_4SEofZi-1p-M75R1lhk/edit#heading=h.ybiv33wzts40\" data-toggle=\"modal\" data-target=\"#external-web-warning\" class=\"external-link\">HTAN Publication Policy <i class=\"fa-solid fa-external-link external-link-icon\" aria-hidden=\"true\"></i></a> information page.</p>",

Specifically, the VHP provides a public-domain library of cross-sectional cryosection, CT, and MRI images obtained from one male cadaver and one female cadaver. The Visible Man data set was publicly released in 1994 and the Visible Woman in 1995.</p>\n<p>The data sets were designed to serve as (1) a reference for the study of human anatomy, (2) public-domain data for testing medical imaging algorithms, and (3) a test bed and model for the construction of network-accessible image libraries. The VHP data sets have been applied to a wide range of educational, diagnostic, treatment planning, virtual reality, artistic, mathematical, and industrial uses. About 4,000 licensees from 66 countries were authorized to access the datasets. As of 2019, a license is no longer required to access the VHP datasets.</p>\n<p>\n       Courtesy of the U.S. National Library of Medicine.

The bile duct is a network of tubes that carry bile from the liver and gallbladder to the small intestine. Tumors that start in bile duct branches that lie inside the liver are called intrahepatic bile duct cancer, while those that form outside the liver are called extrahepatic bile duct cancer. About 10% of all cholangiocarcinoma are intrahepatic and 90% are extrahepatic. TCGA studied both subtypes of cholangiocarcinoma.</p>\n<p>\n      Although cholangiocarcinoma is a rare cancer, the incidence and mortality rates for the disease have been increasing worldwide in the last three decades. Between 2,000 and 3,000 Americans are diagnosed with cholangiocarcinoma each year, the majority of them with tumors at advanced stages. This cancer is more prevalent in Asia and the Middle East, where parasitic infection of the bile duct increases the risk of cholangiocarcinoma. Other diseases of the bile duct or liver, such as bile duct stones and liver disease, obesity, diabetes, and smoking are also risk factors. When intrahepatic and extrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma spread to other parts of the body, only 2% of patients survive five years after diagnosis.</p>\n<p>\n       Please see the <a href=\"https://www.cancer.gov/about-nci/organization/ccg/research/structural-genomics/tcga/studied-cancers/cholangiocarcinoma\" target=\"_blank\">TCGA-CHOL</a> information page to learn more about the images and to obtain any supporting metadata for this collection.</p>\n<p>\n      Citation guidelines can be found on the <a href=\"https://www.cancer.gov/about-nci/organization/ccg/research/structural-genomics/tcga/using-tcga/citing-tcga\" target=\"_blank\">Citing TCGA in Publications and Presentations</a> information page.</p>",

When exposed to sun, these cells make more melanin, causing the skin to darken or tan. Melanoma can occur anywhere on the body and risk factors include fair complexion, family history of melanoma, and being exposed to natural or artificial sunlight over long periods of time. Melanoma is most often discovered because it has metastasized, or spread, to another organ, such as the lymph nodes. In many cases, the primary skin melanoma site is never found. Because of this challenge, TCGA is studying primarily metastatic cases (in contrast to other cancers selected for study, where metastatic cases are excluded). For 2011, it was estimated that there were 70,230 new cases of melanoma and 8,790 deaths from the disease.</p>\n<p>\n       Please see the <a href=\"https://www.cancer.gov/about-nci/organization/ccg/research/structural-genomics/tcga/studied-cancers/pancreatic\" target=\"_blank\">TCGA-SKCM</a> information page to learn more about the images and to obtain any supporting metadata for this collection.</p>\n<p>\n      Citation guidelines can be found on the <a href=\"https://www.cancer.gov/about-nci/organization/ccg/research/structural-genomics/tcga/using-tcga/citing-tcga\" target=\"_blank\">Citing TCGA in Publications and Presentations</a> information page.</p>",

            "description": "</p>\n      More than 90% of testicular cancer start in the germ cells, which are cells in the testicles and develop into sperm. This type of cancer is known as testicular germ cell cancer. Testicular germ cell cancer can be classified as either seminomas or nonseminomas, which may be identified by microscopy. Nonseminomas typically grow and spread more quickly than seminomas. A testicular germ cell tumor that contains a mix of both these subtypes is classified as a nonseminoma. TCGA studied both seminomas and nonseminomas.</p>\n<p>\n      Testicular germ cell cancer is rare, comprising 1-2% of all tumors in males. However, it is the most common cancer in men ages 15 to 35. The incidence of testicular germ cell cancer has been continuously rising in many countries, including Europe and the U.S. In 2013, about 8,000 American men were estimated to be diagnosed with the cancer. Of those, 370 are predicted to die from the disease. Men who are Caucasian, have an undescended testicle, abnormally developed testicles, or a family history of testicular cancer have a greater risk of developing testicular cancer. Fortunately, testicular germ cell cancer is highly treatable.</p>\n<p>\n       Please see the <a href=\"https://www.cancer.gov/about-nci/organization/ccg/research/structural-genomics/tcga/studied-cancers/testicular-germ-cell\" target=\"_blank\">TCGA-TGCT</a> information page to learn more about the images and to obtain any supporting metadata for this collection.</p>\n<p>\n      Citation guidelines can be found on the <a href=\"https://www.cancer.gov/about-nci/organization/ccg/research/structural-genomics/tcga/using-tcga/citing-tcga\" target=\"_blank\">Citing TCGA in Publications and Presentations</a> information page.</p>",
